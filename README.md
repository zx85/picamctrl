# picamctrl

A project created so that I can control an RS485 camera using PELCO-D protocol from my Raspberry pi.

## What you'll need

- A Raspberry Pi (old as you like, as long as it has a 40 pin GPIO)
- An RS485 HAT. I Spent a whole Â£12 on this: https://thepihut.com/products/rs485-pizero by [AB Electronics](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/77/rs485-pi)
- Python Flask

## How to install

- Dunno really
